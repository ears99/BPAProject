# BPAProject
A project of something I made at Business Professionals of America

# Project objective
To create a parser to parse natural language. 
There were two files, named_entities.txt, and human_jabber.txt.
human_jabber.txt contained text - sentances (separated by periods), words (separated by spaces), and paragraphs (separated by newlines).

named_entities contained a list of proper nouns. At the parsing phase, the program would count the number of words, paragraphs, and sentances, and the number of proper nouns. 

It was really interesting! Challenging, but interesting!
